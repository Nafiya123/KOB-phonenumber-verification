# KOB PHONE NUMBER VERIFICATION SERVICE
# ABSTRACT
The KOB Phone Number Verification Service is a part of Kochi Org Book Project.In this project the user is provided with a digital credential that will prove his ownership over the number given by him.The front end of the project is intented to recieve the user's phone number. The service will prove the ownership and sent a digital proof for the same to user. This proof is stored in user's digital wallet.  Further this proof can be used to avail any other service. That is, if the user reguired to submit his number like to get a license, then this digital credential of number can be given as a proof of his number.
# MOTIVATION
In many shops or to avail several services we require to provide our phone number as an identifier.But how the service provider knows that the number belongs to you?In most cases they will send an OTP.So for differrent services you will have to recieve many OTP messages.OTP mechanism is easy and useful but it comes with a few problems like it is valid till a deadline,wrong entery of OTP requires to generate another one.So a single proof for the given number will be somewhat easier.This will help a person to prove his ownership over the number he provided.
# STATUS
Incubation.
# SOLUTION
BY this project we are actually verifying an input phone number. This can be verified by sending an OTP. After verifying a digital proof for the same will created and provided to user.Whenever it requires to prove one's number he only needs to present this digital credential to the service provder.
